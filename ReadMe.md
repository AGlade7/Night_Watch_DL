## Night_Watch

### A Ai/ML model to find the suspicious activity or stealing of cycles activity using the camera footage or videos

## tools Used
  <ul>
    <li>Google Colab</li>
    <li>yolov5</li>
    <li>GPU</li>
  </ul>
  
## How to run
  <ul>
    <li>Before running the any terminal make sure you are running your notebook on GPU instead of CPU. To check just go on runtime/change runtime type it should be on GPU</li>
    <li>First download the ipynb file</li>
    <li>Run the first kernel to download the some files and dependencies for yolov5</li>
    <li>Now we need to add a file custom.yaml inside the yolov5/data folder</li>
    <li>Add the dataset folder into your drive </li>
    <li>Run the secong kernel of notebook it will connect to you drive to fetch the dataset</li>
    <li>now run third terminal for prediction or model validation</li>
    <li>now to test the model that it is running fine or now upload the demo.mp4 file inside your notebook</li>
    <li>Now run the fourth terminal to run the model in our video</li>
    <li>Download the video from the directory yolov5/runs/detect then download the demo.mp4 file again and run it you will see some prediction there</li>
  </ul>
